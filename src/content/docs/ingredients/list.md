## Our blend

We use a balanced mix for texture, nutrition, and taste:

- **Large Rolled Oats** – classic base; creamy when soaked.
- **Pearl Barley** – hearty chew; adds minerals and fiber.
- **White Sesame Seeds** – subtle nuttiness; healthy fats.
- **Flax Seeds** – omega-3s and fiber; helps thickness.
- **Hemp Seeds** – plant protein and healthy fats.
- **Amaranth** – ancient grain; micronutrient dense.
- **Quinoa Flakes** – light, quick-soaking protein boost.
- **Chia Seeds** – gel-forming fiber for that pudding feel.

> No artificial flavors or sweeteners. Sweeten to taste (honey, maple, dates, fruit).
