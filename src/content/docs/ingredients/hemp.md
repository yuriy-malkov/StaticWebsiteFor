Hulled hemp seeds—often called **hemp hearts**—come from *Cannabis sativa*. The outer shell is removed, leaving a soft, nutty kernel that’s easy to add to salads, smoothies, yogurt, and baked goods. Though they’re from the cannabis plant, hemp hearts contain only **trace amounts of THC** and have **no intoxicating effect**.

Nutritionally, hulled hemp seeds are dense in **plant protein**, **healthy fats**, and essential minerals. They’re particularly noted for a balanced **omega-6 : omega-3** ratio and make a convenient protein boost for vegetarian and vegan diets.

## Key Points

1. **May support heart health**  
   Rich in arginine and unsaturated fats that may help lower blood pressure and inflammation—both heart-risk factors.

2. **May benefit skin**  
   Balanced omega-3 and omega-6 intake is associated with improved moisture and reduced irritation in inflammatory skin conditions (e.g., eczema/dermatitis).

   Fiber supports regularity and gut function. (Note: hulled seeds have less fiber than whole seeds but can still help.)
