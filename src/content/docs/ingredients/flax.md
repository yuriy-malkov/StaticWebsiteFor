title: Flax Seeds
description: What flax (linseed) is, why ground flax is recommended, and the main health benefits.
---

Flax seeds—also called **linseeds**—are small golden or brown seeds from the flax plant. Cultivated for thousands of years, they’re valued for versatility in cooking and a powerful nutrition profile: **omega-3 (ALA) fats**, **lignans** (antioxidants), and **dietary fiber** that can support heart and digestive health.

Beyond sprinkling on cereal or salads, **ground flax** (flaxseed meal) is popular in smoothies, energy bars, and vegan baking (as an **egg substitute**). Because whole seeds can pass through undigested, most experts recommend **consuming flax ground** to maximize absorption.
