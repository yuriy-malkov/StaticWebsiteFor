description: What flax (linseed) is, why ground flax is recommended, and the main health benefits.
---

Flax seeds—also called **linseeds**—are small golden or brown seeds from the flax plant. Cultivated for thousands of years, they’re valued for versatility in cooking and a powerful nutrition profile: **omega-3 (ALA) fats**, **lignans** (antioxidants), and **dietary fiber** that can support heart and digestive health.

Beyond sprinkling on cereal or salads, **ground flax** (flaxseed meal) is popular in smoothies, energy bars, and vegan baking (as an **egg substitute**). Because whole seeds can pass through undigested, most experts recommend **consuming flax ground** to maximize absorption.

## Key Points

1. **May support weight management**  
   Fiber and healthy fats promote fullness and may reduce overall calorie intake.  

2. **Promotes heart health**  
   Omega-3s (ALA), lignans, and fiber are associated with improved heart markers.  

3. **May help regulate blood pressure & cholesterol**  
   Regular intake is linked with healthier BP and improved cholesterol profiles.  

4. **Supports digestion**  
   Soluble + insoluble fiber can help relieve constipation and support regularity.  

## Summary
Flax seeds are a versatile, nutrient-dense addition to meals. Evidence links them with benefits for **heart health**, **blood pressure and cholesterol**, **digestion**, and **satiety**. For best results, choose **ground flax** to aid digestion and nutrient uptake.
