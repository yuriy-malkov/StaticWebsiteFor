Barley is an ancient cereal grain cultivated for thousands of years and widely appreciated for its nutty flavor and satisfying, chewy texture. Commonly used in soups, stews, and beverages (such as beer, where barley malt is key), this grain offers an impressive nutritional profile that includes vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber.

A standout component of barley is **beta-glucan**, a type of soluble fiber linked to various health benefits. Multiple sources report that beta-glucan may help lower cholesterol, regulate blood sugar, and support digestive health. Whether you choose hulled barley (the least processed) or pearled barley (more processed but still nutritious), this hearty grain can easily become a satisfying and beneficial addition to any meal.
