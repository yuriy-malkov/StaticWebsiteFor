Chia seeds are tiny black or white seeds from *Salvia hispanica*, a mint-family plant native to Central and South America. A staple in Aztec and Mayan diets, chia has surged in popularity thanks to its rich nutrition—especially omega-3 (ALA), antioxidants, fiber, and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. When mixed with liquid, chia forms a gel, making it versatile for smoothies, puddings, breads, and cereals.
