Chia seeds are tiny black or white seeds from *Salvia hispanica*, a mint-family plant native to Central and South America. A staple in Aztec and Mayan diets, chia has surged in popularity thanks to its rich nutrition—especially omega-3 (ALA), antioxidants, fiber, and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. When mixed with liquid, chia forms a gel, making it versatile for smoothies, puddings, breads, and cereals.

## Key Points

1. **Rich plant source of omega-3 (ALA)**  
   Regular intake can raise blood levels of omega-3s linked to heart health.  

2. **May improve blood sugar control**  
   High fiber and protein can slow carbohydrate absorption and steady post-meal glucose.  

3. **May help lower blood pressure**  
   Omega-3s and potassium may support healthy blood pressure.  

4. **Supports digestion and gut health**  
   ~10g fiber per 28g serving can aid regularity and a healthy microbiome.  

5. **May aid weight management**  
   Soluble fiber + protein promote fullness, which may reduce overall calorie intake.  

6. **Minerals for bone health**  
   Good source of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium—important for bones.  

## Summary
Chia seeds are nutrient-dense and easy to use. Their fiber, omega-3s, and key minerals are associated with benefits for heart health, blood sugar, digestion, weight management, and bones. Thanks to a mild flavor and gelling ability, they fit seamlessly into many dishes.
