Quinoa (pronounced **KEEN-wah**) is often called an ancient grain, though it’s technically a seed native to the Andes. It’s popular for its balanced nutrition—**complex carbs, complete protein, and fiber**—plus a light, nutty flavor that works in salads, stir-fries, bowls, and as a rice alternative. Quinoa is **naturally gluten-free**, making it a useful option for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity (when sourced to avoid cross-contamination).

## Key Points

1. **May help regulate blood sugar**  
   Its fiber + protein combo can slow glucose release and improve post-meal blood sugar control.  

2. **May aid weight management**  
   Higher protein and fiber promote satiety, which can help reduce overall calorie intake.  

3. **Complete plant protein**  
   Contains all nine essential amino acids—valuable for vegetarian and vegan diets.  

4. **Supports digestion**  
   ~5g fiber per cooked cup helps regularity and a healthy gut environment.  

5. **Rich in micronutrients**  
   Notable for magnesium, iron, and B vitamins that support energy metabolism and muscle/nerve function.  

## Summary
Quinoa is a versatile, **gluten-free** seed with a standout nutrition profile: **complete protein, ample fiber, and key minerals**. It can support blood sugar control and satiety while adding variety to everyday meals.
